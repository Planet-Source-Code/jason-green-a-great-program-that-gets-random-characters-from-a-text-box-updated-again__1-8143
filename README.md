## A great program that gets random characters from a text box\!\(Updated again\!\!\)


</div>

### Description

I looked on this site to find something like this, but i didnt find exactly what i wanted. Here is the source that i created that takes random characters from a text box and places them in a label. It takes a user defined amount of characters including spaces and periods and everything else. =) UPDATED AGAIN!! Now has added features! Can count characters and vowels and words etc! If you know a better way to do this, please email me. This type of program can

be used for fortunes, making up new

words, choosing usernames(i actually

know somebody that did this with a

similar program), etc. PLEASE VOTE!!!
